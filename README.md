k OUT OF n VISUAL CRYPTOGRAPHY ALGORITHMS The proposed algorithm for visual cryptography is used to generate n shares using the encryption algorithms with a specified value of k and n. All n shares are used to generate a recovered image, which is the encrypted version of the input image, which is then decrypted by simply stacking k shares together.
